**Learn OOPs Concepts in Java - A Simple Guide**


Struggling in understanding OOPS! i will just say one thing when ever you are starting with OOPS dont study it like a theory - study by imagining the real world entities
First of all why OOPS? - its really simple - you go to supermarket if you dont know what to buy or what you can buy you will be perplexed right?
thats where the your moms "chitti" (for telugu ppl) or groceries list will be you saviour you know what  you can buy . 
Similar to that objects know what they can do and where they came from through their class(lets say family) .and with that list of properties (you chitti) and the capability of your buying/paying(function) you can go to any super market and do the things which you can do ---just by defining what you know.
So -thats where you know OOPS importance where you can have differnt families which have differnt children with their own chittis to do go wherever they want and do perform their funtions!!!!!!!!

Welcome to this simple project where we cover all the essential Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and Java keywords with easy-to-understand examples. This guide is perfect for beginners and will help you get a solid understanding of OOPs in just 10 minutes!

What You'll Learn:
Class: Think of it as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines what data and behaviors the objects will have.[family)

Object: An instance of a class, representing a real-world thing or concept.(child who travels everywhere)

As now you know what is you chitti how well advanced you are in creating / performing the duties can be understand through the OOPs principles.

Encapsulation: Wrapping data (like variables) and methods together into a single unit (class).

Inheritance: The ability to create a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods.

Polymorphism: Allowing different classes to use the same method but behave differently.

Abstraction: Hiding complex details and showing only whatâ€™s necessary for the user.

Key Java Keywords Explained:
class: Used to define a class. Example: public class User {...}

object: An instance of a class. Example: User user = new User();

static: Refers to class-level variables or methods, shared by all instances. Example: static int serviceCharge;

final: Makes things unchangeable. Used for constants or preventing changes. Example: final int MAX_LIMIT = 100;

abstract: A class that can't be instantiated, meant to be extended. Example: abstract class PaymentDetails {...}

extends: Used to create a subclass that inherits from a superclass. Example: class Payment extends PaymentDetails {...}

implements: Used to implement an interface (a contract for classes to follow). Example: class Payment implements Charges {...}

super: Refers to the parent class. Used to call methods or constructors from the parent. Example: super(bill);

override: Used to modify the behavior of a method from a parent class. Example: @Override public void billPaid() {...}

public: Makes a method or variable accessible to all classes. Example: public void getUser() {...}

private: Restricts access to a method or variable within the same class. Example: private String name;
