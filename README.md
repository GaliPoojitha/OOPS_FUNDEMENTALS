Learn OOP Concepts in Java - A Simple Guide
Welcome to this simple project where we cover all the essential Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and Java keywords with easy-to-understand examples. This guide is perfect for beginners and will help you get a solid understanding of OOP in just 10 minutes!

What You'll Learn:
Class: Think of it as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines what data and behaviors the objects will have.

Object: An instance of a class, representing a real-world thing or concept.

Encapsulation: Wrapping data (like variables) and methods together into a single unit (class).

Inheritance: The ability to create a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods.

Polymorphism: Allowing different classes to use the same method but behave differently.

Abstraction: Hiding complex details and showing only whatâ€™s necessary for the user.

Key Java Keywords Explained:
class: Used to define a class. Example: public class User {...}

object: An instance of a class. Example: User user = new User();

static: Refers to class-level variables or methods, shared by all instances. Example: static int serviceCharge;

final: Makes things unchangeable. Used for constants or preventing changes. Example: final int MAX_LIMIT = 100;

abstract: A class that can't be instantiated, meant to be extended. Example: abstract class PaymentDetails {...}

extends: Used to create a subclass that inherits from a superclass. Example: class Payment extends PaymentDetails {...}

implements: Used to implement an interface (a contract for classes to follow). Example: class Payment implements Charges {...}

super: Refers to the parent class. Used to call methods or constructors from the parent. Example: super(bill);

override: Used to modify the behavior of a method from a parent class. Example: @Override public void billPaid() {...}

public: Makes a method or variable accessible to all classes. Example: public void getUser() {...}

private: Restricts access to a method or variable within the same class. Example: private String name;
